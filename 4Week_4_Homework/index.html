<header>The Wonderful World of Collecting Starbucks Cups</header>
    
    <p class="info"> Everyone knows that Starbucks is famous of their coffee. Even if you are not a coffee drinker
        the options for you can still be unlimited. You have the option to select tasty teas or indulge in a pastry or two.
        But there is another side of Starbucks that only a special type of collector is privy to. It's <b>CUPS</b>! Starbucks
        has a big following of individuals that LOVE to collect Starbucks cups. Starbucks has quarterly
        release of different styles of cups that may vary depending on the season. The cup releases are 
        not just for the United States but they are <b>WORLD WIDE</b>. The downside of this "guilty pleasure",
        is that the cups can be diffult to locate and this is when scammers and resellers step into the picture.
        Typically cups can range from $16-$25 on average. However, when they are in the hands of resellers certain 
        cups can sell for $50+. I have personally seen a cup sell for $200.  
    </p>
    <h2>Cup Styles</h2>
    <p class="info">There are so many different styles of cups that you can choose from. This is why so many different types
        of people love collecting them. They have different styles to fit any personality. Below is a list of 
        the different names of the cups.
        <ul>
            <li>The Studded Cup (Most Popular)</li>
            <li> The Stainless Steel Cup</li>
            <li>The Acrylic Cup</li>
            <li>The Reusable Hot Cup</li>        
        </ul>
        <p> Starbucks collectors are not only on the hunt for cups in the United States, but other countries also. True
            collectors have the "deets" on when and where new cups are being released. Below is a list of countries that also have these AWESOME cups.</p>
